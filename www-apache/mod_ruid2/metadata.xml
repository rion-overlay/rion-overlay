<description>a suexec module for apache which takes advantage of POSIX.1e capabilities</description> 
</maintainer>

<longdescription>With this module, all httpd process run under user's access
right, not nobody or apache. mod_ruid2 is similar to mod_suid2, but has better performance than mod_suid2 because it
doesn`t need to kill httpd children after one request. It makes use of kernel capabilites
and after receiving a new request suids again. If you want to run apache modules, i.e.
WebDAV, PHP, and so on under user's right, this module is useful.</longdescription>
