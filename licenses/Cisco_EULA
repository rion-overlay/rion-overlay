IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS CISCO PACKET TRACER SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT (THE
"AGREEMENT") CAREFULLY.  DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING OR USING THE CISCO PACKET 
TRACER SOFTWARE CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE
TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THEN CISCO SYSTEMS, INC. ("CISCO") IS 
UNWILLING TO LICENSE THE SOFTWARE TO YOU AND YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO 
DOWNLOAD, INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE.  

I.      DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS.  The terms in this Section I ("Distribution 
Rights") of the Agreement apply solely to any Cisco Networking Academy 
instructor, administrator or other person or entity approved in writing by 
Cisco Systems, Inc. (each, an "Instructor") to distribute and use the Cisco 
Packet Tracer software and related documentation (collectively, the "Software")
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.   

        Subject to the terms and conditions of the End User License Agreement 
        set forth in Section II below (the "EULA"), Cisco grants Instructor a 
        limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable license to distribute the 
        Software using the Permitted Distribution Methods (defined below), 
        during the term of the Agreement to Permitted End Users (defined below)
        solely as reasonably necessary to provide networking training or 
        instruction in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
        Agreement.  The Permitted Distribution Methods are:  (i) distribution 
        via a password protected website (WAN distribution), Local Area Network
        (LAN distribution) or FTP server; or (ii) distribution via CD's or 
        other tangible media containing the Software.  Instructor shall not 
        remove the EULA from the Software.  Instructor shall use reasonable 
        efforts to ensure Permitted End Users comply with the EULA.  Permitted
        End Users are students, faculty or alumni of Cisco Networking Academy
        or such other individuals or entities approved in writing by Cisco.  
        Instructors shall not make any copies or duplicates of the Software 
        except as reasonably necessary to exercise the rights granted 
        hereunder.  Except to the extent set forth herein, no distribution, 
        marketing or other transfer of the Software is permitted.  Without 
        limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Software may not be 
        copied, licensed, sub-licensed, sold or otherwise distributed in 
        exchange for any fee or value-in-kind.
        
        Instructor acknowledges and agrees that Cisco retains sole and 
        exclusive title and ownership to the Software, including all copies 
        thereof, all Cisco trademarks, designations, logos and other branding 
        for the Software and all intellectual property rights in or to any of 
        the foregoing. 
        
        Cisco may terminate the Distribution Rights granted hereunder for any
        reason or no reason on five (5) business days notice.  Unless earlier
        terminated as set forth in the preceding sentence, the term of this 
        Agreement shall continue until Instructor is no longer a Cisco 
        Networking Academy instructor, administrator or other person or entity
        approved in writing by Cisco to exercise the rights set forth in this 
        Agreement.  
        
II.     The following End User License Agreement or "EULA" shall apply to all 
users of the Software:          

                         End User License Agreement 
BY DOWNLOADING OR INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE YOU ARE BINDING YOURSELF AND/OR THE 
ENTITY THAT YOU REPRESENT (COLLECTIVELY, "USER") TO THIS END USER LICENSE 
AGREEMENT ("EULA").  The following terms of this EULA govern access to and use
of the Software.

License. Conditioned upon compliance with the terms and conditions of this 
EULA, Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco") grants to User a royalty free, personal, 
nonexclusive, nontransferable and revocable license to use the Cisco Packet 
Tracer software and related documentation (collectively, the "Software") solely
to create, display or run network simulations using files with suffixes ".pkt" 
or ".pka" (collectively, "Activities") in connection with Cisco Networking 
Academy or for such other purpose(s) approved by Cisco in writing.   No license
is granted for any other purpose and there are no implied licenses in this 
EULA.  

General Limitations. This is a license, not a transfer of title, to the 
Software and Cisco retains ownership of all copies of the Software.  User 
acknowledges and agrees that Cisco and/or its suppliers own all right, title
and interest in and to the Software, including without limitation, any and all
copyrights, patents, trade secrets, trademarks and other intellectual property
rights therein.  Cisco has the exclusive right to apply for or register any 
patents, mask work rights, copyrights, or such other proprietary protections 
with respect to the Software.  User will not earn or acquire any rights or 
licenses under any copyrights, patents, trade secrets, trademarks or other 
intellectual property rights on account of this EULA.  Except as otherwise 
expressly provided under this EULA, User shall have no right, and User 
specifically agrees not to:

        (i) transfer, assign or sublicense its license rights to any other 
        person or entity, and User acknowledges that any attempted transfer,
        assignment, sublicense or use shall be void;
        
        (ii) make error corrections to or otherwise modify or adapt the 
        Software or create derivative works (excluding Activities) based upon
        the Software, or permit third parties to do the same;
        
        (iii) reverse engineer or decompile, decrypt, disassemble or otherwise
        reduce the Software to human-readable form, except to the extent 
        otherwise expressly permitted under applicable law notwithstanding this
        restriction;
        
        (iv) use or permit the Software to be used to perform services for 
        third parties, whether on a service bureau or time sharing basis or 
        otherwise, without the express written authorization of Cisco; or
        
        (v) disclose, provide, or otherwise make available trade secrets 
        contained within the Software in any form to any third party without 
        the prior written consent of Cisco.  User shall implement reasonable 
        security measures to protect such trade secrets.  
        
To the extent required by law, and at User's written request, Cisco shall 
provide User with the interface information needed to achieve interoperability
between the Software and another independently created program, on payment of 
Cisco's applicable fee, if any. User shall observe strict obligations of 
confidentiality with respect to such interface information and shall use such 
interface information in compliance with any reasonable terms and conditions 
upon which Cisco makes such interface information available.

Software, Upgrades and Additional Copies. For purposes of this EULA, "Software"
shall include (and the terms and conditions of this EULA shall apply to) 
computer programs, as provided to User by Cisco or an authorized agent and any 
upgrades, updates, bug fixes or modified versions thereto (collectively, 
"Upgrades") or backup copies of the Software permitted hereunder.  
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS EULA: (1) USER HAS NO LICENSE OR 
RIGHT TO USE ANY UPGRADES OR ADDITIIONAL COPIES UNLESS USER, AT THE TIME OF 
ACQUIRING SUCH COPY OR UPGRADE, ALREADY HOLDS A VALID LICENSE TO THE ORIGINAL 
SOFTWARE; AND (2) THE MAKING AND USE OF ADDITIONAL COPIES IS LIMITED TO 
NECESSARY BACKUP PURPOSES ONLY.

Proprietary Notices. User agrees to maintain and reproduce all copyright and 
other proprietary notices on all copies, in any form, of the Software in the 
same form and manner that such copyright and other proprietary notices are 
included on the Software. Except as expressly authorized in this EULA, User 
shall not make any copies or duplicates of any Software without the prior 
written permission of Cisco.

Term and Termination.  Provided User complies with the terms and conditions 
of this EULA, the license granted herein shall remain in effect for so long 
as User remains a Permitted End User, as determined by Cisco in its sole 
discretion.  User may terminate this EULA and the license at any time by 
destroying all copies of the Software. User's rights under this EULA will 
terminate immediately without notice from Cisco if User fails to comply with 
any provision of this EULA. Upon termination, User shall destroy all copies of
Software in its possession or control. All confidentiality obligations of User
and all limitations of liability and disclaimers and restrictions of warranty 
shall survive termination of this EULA. In addition, the provisions of the 
sections titled "U.S. Government End User Purchasers" and "General Terms 
Applicable to the Limited Warranty Statement and Software License" shall 
survive termination of this EULA.

Export.  The Software, including technical data, may be subject to U.S. export
control laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Act and its associated 
regulations, and may be subject to export or import regulations in other 
countries. User agrees to comply strictly with all such regulations and 
acknowledges that it has the responsibility to obtain licenses to export, 
re-export, or import the Software.

U.S. Government End User Purchasers. The Software qualifies as "commercial 
items," as that term is defined at Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") 
(48 C.F.R.) 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial 
computer software documentation" as such terms are used in FAR 12.212. 
Consistent with FAR 12.212 and DoD FAR Supp. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, and
notwithstanding any other FAR or other contractual clause to the contrary in 
any agreement into which this EULA may be incorporated, User may provide to 
Government end user or, if this agreement is direct, Government end user will 
acquire, the Software with only those rights set forth in this EULA. Use of 
the Software constitutes agreement by the Government that the Software and 
related documentation are "commercial computer software" and "commercial 
computer software documentation," and constitutes acceptance of the rights and
restrictions herein.

No Warranty
THE SOFTWARE FURNISHED UNDER THIS EULA IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR 
STATUTORY; INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, 
NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NOR ARE 
THERE ANY WARRANTIES CREATED BY A COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR 
TRADE USAGE. CISCO DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET USER'S NEEDS OR
WILL BE FREE FROM ERRORS, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE 
UNINTERRUPTED. THE FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART 
OF THIS EULA AND FORMED THE BASIS FOR DETERMINING THE FEES CHARGED FOR THE 
SOFTWARE.  

Disclaimer of Liabilities. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN 
FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE, IN NO EVENT WILL CISCO OR ITS 
SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT, OR LOST OR DAMAGED DATA, 
NETWORK FAILURE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF CAPITAL, OR FOR SPECIAL, 
INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND 
REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY OR WHETHER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR 
INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE AND EVEN IF CISCO OR ITS SUPPLIERS OR 
LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event 
shall Cisco's or its suppliers' or licensors' liability to User, whether in 
contract, tort (including negligence), breach of warranty, or otherwise, exceed
the price paid by User for the Software that gave rise to the claim or if the 
Software is part of another Product, the price paid for such other Product. 
BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF
CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

User agrees that the limitations of liability and disclaimers set forth herein 
will apply regardless of whether User has accepted the Software or any other 
product or service delivered by Cisco. User acknowledges and agrees that Cisco 
has granted the licenses and entered into this relationship in reliance upon 
the disclaimers of warranty and the limitations of liability set forth herein, 
that the same reflect an allocation of risk between the parties (including the 
risk that a contract remedy may fail of its essential purpose and cause 
consequential loss), and that the same form an essential basis of the bargain 
between the parties.

General.  The EULA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the 
laws of the State of California, without reference to or application of 
choice of law rules or principles. The United Nations Convention on the 
International Sale of Goods shall not apply. If any portion hereof is found to
be void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the EULA shall remain in
full force and effect. Except as expressly provided herein, this EULA 
constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the 
license of the Software and supersedes any conflicting or additional terms 
contained in any purchase order or elsewhere, all of which terms are excluded.
This EULA has been written in the English language, and the parties agree that
the English version will govern. User waives any rights User may have under 
the law of User's country or province to have this EULA written in any language
other than English.
